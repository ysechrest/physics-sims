# physics-sims
Collection of simple physics modeling applications.

vacuum_sim contains scripts for simulating the evolution of pressures inside a particular vacuum chamber set-up.

thermal_sim contains a simplified simulation of the temperature evolution of a spherical particle cluster under EUV exposure.

quantum contains scripts for calculating the atomic emission spectra (primarily the motional stark effect spectrum) for the hydrogen atom.

fields_sim contains scripts for calculating and tracing magnetic field configurations.
